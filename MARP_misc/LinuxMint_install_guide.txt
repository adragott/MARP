Creating Partitions:
	First, create a boot partition:
		EXT4, /boot, 2048MB
	Next, create root partition:
		EXT4, /, 30000MB (Size here needs to be at least 20GB)
	Create swap area:
		swaparea, N/A, (swap amount = (RAM * 1024 * 1.5))
				Example: 8GB * 1024 * 1.5 = 12228MB swap size
	Create home partition:
		EXT4, /home, Whatever size you want (where Documents, downloads, videos, etc) goes
	Create usr partition:
		EXT4, /usr, whatever size you want (think of this as where your programs will go, although its not exactly true and its not always the case)
